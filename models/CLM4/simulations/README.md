These scripts are not intended to enable simple sety up and running of the CLM model as it was setup for the EucFACE simulations. Rather they are intended to give information as to how the model was set up, run, and outputs post-processed. The PTCLM scripts were written by Daniel M. Ricciuto and modified by Anthony Walker. Other scripts were written by Anthony Walker. Funding was provided by the ORNL Terrestrial Ecosystem Scince SFA and the FACE Model Data Synthesis projects, both funderd by DOE, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research.
