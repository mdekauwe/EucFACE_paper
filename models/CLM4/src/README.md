s is the CLM4.0 tag 34 FORTRAN code as modified by the ORNL team and with very minor modifications for the EiucFACE simulations. This is not intended for use but as a record of the code used in these simulations. Authorship, licencing and use, and other information for the CLM model version 4.0 can be found here (http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm1.0/clm/) and here (https://www2.ucar.edu/terms-of-use). None of the authors of the CLM model, of which there are many, participated in this project and we thank them for their efforts and for the freedom to use their code.
