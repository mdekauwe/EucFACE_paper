## Overview ##

Scripts assume the met data files are located in
```bash
raw_met_data/model_forcing
```

This directory will be stored on the Hiev, I will update this link when that is done.

###### Re-create the meteorological forcing files ######

```bash
cd met_data
python generate_FORCING_files.py
```
