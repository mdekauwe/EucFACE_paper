Scripts:
- checking scripts to test that model outputs are sensible (check_model_output.py / check_model_output_AVG.py)
- pickling script to generate a big dataframe that holds all the model runs (generate_pickled_model_output.py)
- Note if you want to run the check scripts on the model outputs you will first need to run the generate_pickled_model_output.py to build the object that this script depends on.
